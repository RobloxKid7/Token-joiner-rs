# Discord-Token-Joiner-rs

A simple script designed to make tokens join a discord server. Made in Rust.

## Set up

Place user tokens within the tokens.txt file. Then within main.rs change the invite code to your desired one. Run main.py and your tokens should begin joining, they will not join if they are locked behind email or phone verification, or they are blocked by captcha. I cannot circumvent this.
